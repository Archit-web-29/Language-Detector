# Language-Detector

### A code that detects the language of the files in your desired directory

*Note that this code will not damage your files, but the code may trigger antivirus softwares as it will scan your entire directory.*

These are what the different versions of the code does:
1. V1 - Scans, 15 different languages, cannot scan single files, does not tell pathname
2. V2 - Scans, 75 different languages, cannot scan single files, does not tell pathname
3. V3 - Scans, 75 different languages, can scan single files, tells pathname of singleton language

The code does take some time if you have given a directory that is very big and contains many different files.
